# Authentication Implementation
This document serves as the high-level reference for the entire platform. In case of any discrepancies or conflicts with other documentation, this document should be considered the authoritative source.

## Web Application Authentication

- Web application will implement a standard email/password authentication system
- Social login capabilities are not required for the web application
- Authentication will be managed using NextAuth.js with the following providers:
  - Email/Password provider
  - Credentials provider for custom authentication logic
- JWT tokens will be used for session management
- Session data will be stored in PostgreSQL using NextAuth's session model

## Mobile Application Authentication

- Mobile application will support both email/password and social login authentication
- Supported social login providers:
  - Google authentication
  - Apple authentication (required for iOS apps)
- Mobile authentication will be processed through the web backend
- API routes will be exposed for mobile authentication flows:
  - `/api/v1/auth/login`
  - `/api/v1/auth/register`
  - `/api/v1/auth/social`
  - `/api/v1/auth/refresh`

## Cross-Platform Authentication Flow

1. User authenticates via web or mobile interface
2. Web backend validates credentials and generates JWT token
3. JWT token contains user identity and role information
4. For mobile users, token is returned to mobile app and stored securely
5. For all authenticated users, CouchDB credentials are also returned:
   - Database name for user-specific database
   - Username for CouchDB authentication
   - Password for CouchDB authentication (encrypted in transit)
6. Mobile app stores CouchDB credentials securely using Expo SecureStore
7. Web app maintains CouchDB credentials in server-side session

## Token Refresh Mechanism

- JWT tokens will have a 1-hour expiry
- Refresh tokens will have a 30-day expiry
- Mobile app will automatically request new tokens before expiry
- API route `/api/v1/auth/refresh` will validate refresh tokens and issue new JWTs

## Security Considerations

- All passwords will be hashed using bcrypt before storage
- CouchDB credentials will be encrypted at rest in PostgreSQL
- All authentication endpoints will implement rate limiting
- Failed login attempts will be monitored and temporary lockouts enforced
- HTTPS will be enforced for all API communications
