# Dependencies Between Web and Mobile Projects
This document serves as the high-level reference for the entire platform. In case of any discrepancies or conflicts with other documentation, this document should be considered the authoritative source.

## Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Shared Authentication System**
   - Web authentication system must be implemented before mobile auth integration
   - API routes for mobile login must be ready before mobile auth development

2. **Database Schema Dependencies**
   - PostgreSQL schema must be finalized before mobile user management
   - CouchDB structure must be defined before mobile sync implementation

3. **API Endpoint Dependencies**
   - Core API endpoints must be implemented before mobile can consume them
   - Message and media APIs must be ready before those mobile features

## Timeline Integration Points

| Week | Web Milestone | Mobile Dependency |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| Week 3 | Database setup completed | Mobile can begin PouchDB integration |
| Week 6 | Authentication system ready | Mobile authentication development can start |
| Week 8 | Food database management complete | Mobile food logging can begin development |
| Week 10 | Diet planning system implemented | Mobile diet visualization can start |
| Week 14 | Messaging system completed | Mobile messaging implementation can begin |
| Week 16 | Media management ready | Mobile media capture can integrate with backend |

## Parallel Development Strategy

- Mobile app structure and UI can be developed in parallel with web app
- Shared types package should be developed early to facilitate coordination
- API contract should be defined before implementation to enable parallel work
- Regular integration testing should occur throughout development
